# AutomatedCarParkingDetection

With the problem of increasing urban traffic congestion, one of the major issues in metropolitan cities is searching for a parking space. The project aims to build a system for the detection of parking space with the help of image processing technique. The system will detect cars through images instead of electronic sensors. A camera is installed at a high and fixed position in the parking lot. An image of empty parking lot will be taken as reference and then an image of parking lot with cars will be taken. Both the images will be subtracted to find the numbers of parking slots available. Therefore, the system will help in counting the number of parked vehicles and, identifying the number of spots available.
